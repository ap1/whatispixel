# What is Pixel?

Thank you for your responses! We just got the results, and it looks like our Pixel is basically a spaghetti / mixed-veg of breeds, with a major bend towards Cocker Spaniel:


We love this---his uniqueness is certainly the best part of his personality. That's why our guessing game was fun. 30 people put in their guesses!


Together we clearly got the main trend right. Everyone saw the Spaniel in Pixel. But how did we do individually? No need to wait any more, here are the results. Congrats to Abhimanyu (don't eat puppies!), obelix, and Mikmik for getting the highest score. This was a tough one. As you can see, even Pixel's parents were nowhere close :-)
